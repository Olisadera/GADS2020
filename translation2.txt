LAB: ERROR REPORTING AND DEBUGGING

Objectives:

1. Launch a simple Google App Engine application

2. Introduce an error into the application

3. Explore Cloud Error Reporting

4. Use Cloud Debugger to identify the error in the code

5. Fix the bug and monitor in Cloud Operations


1. CREATE AN APPLICATION:
GET AND TEST THE APPLICATION

    a. Create a local folder and get the App Engine Hello world application:
        i. mkdir appengine-hello
        ii. cd appengine-hello
        iii. gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/archinfra/gae-hello/* .

    b. Run the application using the local development server:
        dev_appserver.py $(pwd)

    c. Preview the application on port 8080

    d. Press Ctrl+C to exit the development server

DEPLOY THE APPLICATION TO APP ENGINE

    a.  Deploy the application to App Engine:
        gcloud app deploy app.yaml
        (If prompted for a region, enter the number corresponding to a region.
        When prompted, type Y to continue.)

    b. Verify that the application is working:
        gcloud app browse
        (If needed, press Ctrl+C to exit the development mode.)

INTRODUCE AN ERROR TO BREAK THE APPLICATION

    a. Examine the main.py file: 
        cat main.py

    b. Use the sed stream editor to change the import library to the nonexistent webapp22:
        sed -i -e 's/webapp2/webapp22/' main.py
    
    c. Verify that you made the change:
        cat main.py

REDEPLOY THE APPLICATION TO APP ENGINE

    a. Re-deploy the application to App Engine:
        gcloud app deploy app.yaml --quite
        (The --quiet flag disables all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands.)

    b. Verify that the application is broken:
        gcloud app browse
        (If needed, press Ctrl+C to exit development mode.)

2. EXPLORE CLOUD ERROR REPORTING
VIEW ERROR REPORTING AND TRIGGER ADITIONAL ERRORS
    a. In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu, click Error Reporting

    b. View details and identify the cause

VIEW THE LOGS AND FIX THE ERROR
    a. Fix the error:
        sed -i -e 's/webapp22/webapp2/' main.py

    b. Re-deploy the application to App Engine:
        gcloud app deploy app.yaml --quiet

    c. Verify that the application is working again:
        gcloud app browse

END LAB!
