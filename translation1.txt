LAB: CONSOLE AND CLOUD SHELL

Objectives:

1. Get access to Google Cloud.

2. Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the Cloud Console.

3. Create a Cloud Storage bucket using Cloud Shell.

4. Become familiar with Cloud Shell features.


1. CREATE A CLOUD STORAGE BUCKET USING CLOUD CONSOLE:

    gsutil mb gs://<BUCKET_NAME>

2. CREATE A CLOUD STORAGE BUCKET USING CLOUD SHELL:

    gsutil mb gs://<BUCKET_NAME>

3. BECOME FAMILIAR WITH CLOUD SHELL FEATURES:
    A. Copy a file from your Cloud Shell virtual machine in your bucket:
        gsutil cp [MY_FILE] gs://[BUCKET_NAME]

    B. Create a persistent state in Cloud Shell:
        i. To list available regions: 
            gcloud compute regions list

        ii. To Create an environmental variable with your choosen region:
            INFRACLASS_REGION=[YOUR_REGION]

        iii. To verify if the variable was created:
            echo $INFRACLASS_REGION

    C. Append the environment variable to a file:
        i. Create a subdirectory:
            mkdir [SUB_DIRECTORY]

        ii. Create a file in the subdirectory:
            touch [SUB_DIRECTORY]/[FILE_NAME]

        iii. Append the value of your Region environment variable to the [FILE_NAME]:
             echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/[SUB_DIRECTORY]/[FILE_NAME]

        iv. Create a second environment variable for your Project ID:
            INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]

        v. Append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the [FILE_NAME]:
            echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/[SUB_DIRECTORY]/[FILE_NAME]

        vi. Set the environment variables in the subdirectory:
            source [SUB_DIRECTORY]/[FILE_NAME]

        vii. Verify that the project variable and region variable was set:
             echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
             echo $INFRACLASS_REGION
    
    D. Modify the bash profile and create persistence:
        i. Edit the shell profile:
            nano .profile

        ii. Add the following line to the end of the file:
            source [SUB_DIRECTORY]/[FILE_NAME]

        iii. Press Ctrl+O, ENTER, and Ctrl+X to exit the nano editor
        
        iv. Close and then re-open Cloud Shell to verify that the variable is still set:
            echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
